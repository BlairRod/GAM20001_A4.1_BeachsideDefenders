Inspiration:
We decided to make an arcade game, the options put forward, to our group, were Space Invaders, Asteroids, Pac-Man, Street Fighter, Mario Bros, Donkey Kong, Gauntlet, Dig Dug, Double Dragon, Contra, Rampage.
As a group we chose Space Invaders as our game’s theme, but with a different setting, we chose to make the game with Space Invaders’ mechanics as the base mechanics while also breathing some colour into our game. As the original game only used black and white colours, we wanted both a bright background and to also reskin all the assets to reflect our theme & concept that represents our game, Beachside Defenders. We chose to create the game at a beach location since the transition from water to land would slow down any sea creature, it made thematical sense to use the beach for our Space Invaders game. As the beach is last line before the sea creatures would invade inland and destroy the town, we thought this was a fitting position as a last line of defence for our player to make their final stand. Using the colourful umbrellas left behind to act as a barrier, for our player, to block the sea creatures' attacks from consuming our player’s lives.
